### Publications

1. Co-authored: [The origin of the first neutron star -- neutron star merger](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00632)

__In Preparation__

1. Localization of Binary Black Holes in the Local Universe

2. A Data Science Approach Towards the Local Abundance of Globular Clusters


### <a name="NCA"></a> Update localization analysis with Network Coherent Analysis from LIGO - 4/28/2018

1. based on the PhD work from [Dr.
Shihan Weerathunga](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qtaTE_oAAAAJ&hl=en)
    1. use PSO optimizer from his PhD advisor [Dr. Soumya D. Mohanty](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01526)
    2. need to work on the inverse of ill-conditioned matrix, try [Tikanamov's work]


### Data Management and Release

1. Local Globular Cluster Library

2. Local Binary Black Holes (dynamically formed and ejected from globular clusters) Database
